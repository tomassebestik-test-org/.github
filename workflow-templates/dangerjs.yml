# This workflow runs DangerJS to lint pull requests when they are opened, edited, reopened, or synchronized.
# It checks out the PR head and uses the shared DangerJS action to enforce contribution guidelines.
# Note: This will not work in the pull request where the workflow is added due to the `pull_request_target` trigger.
